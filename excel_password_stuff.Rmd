```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Excel Files

```{r files}

```

## Copying Some Code From the Internet

[Here](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-March/273678.html), specifically.

You'll need to install package `RDCOMClient`, which is non-CRAN, apparently.

```{r internetCode}
# devtools::install_github("omegahat/RDCOMClient")
library("RDCOMClient")
eApp <-  COMCreate("Excel.Application")
wk <-  eApp$Workbooks()$Open(Filename="your_file",Password="your_password")
tf <-  tempfile()
wk$Sheets(1)$SaveAs(tf, 3)
```
